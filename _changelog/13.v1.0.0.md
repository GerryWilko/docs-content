## 1.0.0

### September 1, 2023

With this release we are officially declaring FormKit stable and production ready. Many community members have already been using FormKit in production for over a year now and have been very happy with the results. We hope you will be too!

Additionally [FormKit Pro is now available to the general public](/pro) (no early access required). FormKit Pro is still in Beta, and we are working hard to prepare it for a stable release.
