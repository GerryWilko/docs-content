## 1.1.0

### September 20, 2023

### 💪 New features

- Adds new `<FormKitProvider :config="yourConfig">` — a component that defines a new configuration boundary. Any `<FormKit>` components that are nested beneath a `<FormKitProvider>` will inherit their configuration from this location.
- Adds a new `<FormKitLazyProvider>` which checks for a higher order `<Suspense>` boundary (if not found it injects one) and injects a `<FormKitConfigLoader>` component.
- Adds a new `<FormKitConfigLoader>` component. An async component that performs a dynamic import for a configuration file.

Note: The new components listed above are currently experimental and will be documented further as the API stabilizes.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixes a bug in the TypeScript definition of the `<FormKit>` component that causes a TypeScript error in Vue Language Tools (Volar) > `1.8.11`.
- Improves tree shaking across the board for `@formkit/*` packages.
- Fixes a bug in the many of the `alpha`, `alphanumeric`, and `contains_*` validation rules for the `latin` charset.
