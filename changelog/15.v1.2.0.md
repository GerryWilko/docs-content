## 1.2.0

### September 28, 2023

### 💪 New features

- The `select` input now supports grouped options (`<optgroup>`) ([#426](https://github.com/formkit/formkit/issues/426)).
- The `@formkit/nuxt` package now includes an experimental `autoImport` option that only loads FormKit on the pages it is used rather than globally. This will remove FormKit from your entry file. We plan to eventually make this the default behavior and encourage everyone using the current nuxt module to try the new option.
- Significantly improves tree shaking of inputs and configuration options (with manual configuration).
- Adds Tailwind support for new `colorpicker` input.
- Adds new `color` icon.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Zod plugin now iterates over issues not errors ([#945](https://github.com/formkit/formkit/issues/945))
