### Using the CLI 

To get started theming FormKit with Tailwind in your project run the following command in the root of your project:

```bash
npx formkit theme
```

You will be guided through choosing an existing theme as starting point for your project. Run the command again and you will be taken to [https://themes.formkit.com](https://themes.formkit.com) where you can customize your chosen theme.

```bash
# with existing formkit.theme file in your project root
> npx formkit theme
? Found local theme file for <themeName>, edit this theme? › (Y/n)
```

### Using the Web UI

Alternatively you can head directly to [https://themes.formkit.com](https://themes.formkit.com), customize a chosen theme to your liking, and then choose `Download theme` to be given specific commands to run in the root of your project.
